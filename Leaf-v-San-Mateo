OPINION BY: SMITH

OPINION

This is an appeal from summary judgment entered against plaintiffs in
an action in inverse condemnation, continuing nuisance, and dangerous
condition of public property, arising from subsidence-related damage
to real property alleged to be the result of defective sewage and
drainage systems of defendant City of San Mateo.  Summary judgment
was granted on the ground that plaintiffs' suit was barred by the
10-year statute of limitations, Code of Civil Procedure, section
337.15, protecting developers of real estate from unlimited claims
for property damage caused by latent construction defects.

The trial court also found that by virtue of a previous lawsuit arising
out of the same subsidence problem, plaintiffs knew or should have
known the existence of facts giving them a cause of action against
the defendant.

Upon granting the summary judgment, the court also granted the demurrer
without leave to amend of cross-defendant San Mateo Investment Company
because no cause of action was stated.

In January of 1972 the appellants, Ron and Ellen Leaf, purchased
a parcel of real property, which included a duplex, in the City
of San Mateo.  The duplex is believed to have been constructed in
1963, and sold upon completion to the initial owners in June 1963.
Final completion and acceptance of the subdivision is believed to
have occurred in 1965.

Shortly after occupying their duplex in June 1972, the Leafs discovered
that some of the floors were not level, and that there were some
cracks in the exterior of the building.  The Leafs consulted with
two different engineering firms, the first in August 1972 and the
second in July 1973, the consensus being that the structural problems
were being caused by differential settlement and subsidence due to
movement of the fill on plaintiffs' lot caused by water absorption.
The problem was symptomatic on the south side of plaintiffs' duplex,
and the only test borings were made on that side of plaintiffs'
property.  It was recommended that a subsurface drainage system be
installed to stop the subsidence and that the structure be restored to
a level condition approximately one year after drainage installation.

The Leafs attempted to secure a settlement from San Mateo Investment
Company, the developer/builder, and when negotiations failed brought
an action (hereinafter referred to as Suit I) in January 1974 against
San Mateo Investment Company, the sellers, and various engineers and
contractors.  The action sought recovery from the original developers
on the basis of defective engineering and manufacture of plaintiffs'
lot pad and against the former owners for fraud and nondisclosure.
The City of San Mateo was not named in Suit I.  A settlement was
reached in June 1976.

With the proceeds of the settlement, plaintiffs began construction of
the recommended drainage system in August 1976.  While excavating in
the vicinity of City of San Mateo's sewers, a cave-in occurred exposing
a previously excavated sewer trench.  Subsequent investigation revealed
that back-fill in the City of San Mateo's storm  and sanitary sewer
trenches on and near plaintiffs' property had not been compacted, and
that the trenches were acting as subterranean water channels which
were funneling water onto plaintiffs' property.  Investigation also
showed that the section of the sanitary sewer main extending in an
easement along the north side of plaintiffs' home was located too
close to the foundation, and that its close proximity, combined with
lack of compaction of the material in that portion of the trench,
was resulting in the north side of the building being deprived of
lateral and subjacent support.

When the City of San Mateo refused to take action to correct the
alleged defective condition of its property a claim was filed
against it on November 5, 1976, and plaintiffs filed this action
(hereinafter referred to as Suit II) on January 28, 1977, alleging
inverse condemnation, continuing nuisance, and a dangerous and
defective condition of public property.

The city first raised the 10-year statute of limitations in June 1977
by demurrer to the first amended complaint; the demurrer was overruled.
Defendant raised the statute again in January 1979 by way of a motion
for summary judgment and the motion was granted.

We are of the opinion, for the reasons we now state, that the judgment
should be reversed.

At the hearing on summary judgment the defendant City of San Mateo
urged, and the court held, that Code of Civil Procedure section
337.15 barred this action because it was brought more than 10 years
after the date of completion of the construction of the duplex. 1
The purpose  of the 10-year statute is to protect developers of real
estate against liability extending indefinitely into the future.
( Regents of University of California v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co.
(1978) 21 Cal.3d 624, 633, fn. 2 [147 Cal.Rptr. 486, 581 P.2d
197].) Section 337.15 does not protect persons in actual possession
or control, as owner or otherwise, of the offending property at
the time of the proximate cause of the injury.   (Code Civ. Proc.,
? 337.15, subd. (e); Regents of University of California, supra,
at p. 632; Eden v. Van Tine (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 879, 885-886 [148
Cal.Rptr. 215].) Defendant city was in possession and control of the
storm and sanitary sewer easements on and near plaintiffs' property.
Therefore, City of San Mateo was not within the protected class,
specifically developers, which was intended by this statute.

The trial court was in error in holding that the City of San Mateo,
an owner in possession and control, was insulated from liability by
section 337.15.

Defendant, while not completely abandoning the theory that section
337.15 insulates it from liability, urges that, even if the trial
court erred in its reasoning, it made the correct decision, and
therefore should be affirmed, citing Smith v. Walter E. Heller &
Co. (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 259 [147 Cal.Rptr.  1], and cases cited
therein; 6 Witkin, California Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, section
226, pages 4215-4216.  Defendant contends that summary judgment was
proper because either: 1) other applicable statutes of limitations
bar plaintiffs from maintaining Suit II; or 2) Suit I and Suit II are
identical and therefore "fundamental rules of pleading" bar Suit II;
or 3) the releases executed by plaintiffs in Suit I acted to release
defendant City of San Mateo.

Whether or not plaintiffs' claim is barred by some other applicable
statute of limitations 2 is dependent upon a determination of when
the  cause of action accrued.  The question of when plaintiffs'
cause of action accrued is a mixed question of law and fact.
( Avner v. Longridge Estates (1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 607, 617 [77
Cal.Rptr. 633]; Oakes v. McCarthy Co. (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 231, 255
[73 Cal.Rptr. 127].)

Defendant in this action takes the position that plaintiffs' cause of
action accrued when plaintiffs became aware of the damage to their
property, i.e., when they noticed the unlevel floors and cracks
in the building exterior.  Plaintiffs, on the other hand, urge the
"rule of discovery," which would start a statute running only when
plaintiffs not only were aware of the damage, but became aware of
its negligent cause, i.e., at the time of the cave-in.

The traditional rule in tort cases is that the statute of limitations
begins to run upon the occurrence of the last fact essential to the
cause of action.  Although sometimes harsh, the fact that plaintiff
is neither aware of his cause of action nor of the identity of a
wrongdoer will not toll the statute.   (Saliter v. Pierce Brothers
Mortuaries (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 292, 296 [146 Cal.Rptr. 271]; Neel
v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 187
[98 Cal.Rptr.  837, 491 P.2d 421]; Howe v. Pioneer Mfg. Co.  (1968)
262 Cal.App.2d 330, 340 [68 Cal.Rptr. 617].)

The harshness of this rule has been ameliorated in some cases where it
is manifestly unjust to deprive plaintiffs of a cause of action before
they are aware that they have been injured.  This modified rule has
been  applied to latent defects in real property and improvements.
( Regents of University of California v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co.,
supra, 21 Cal.3d 624; Mehl v. People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks., supra,
13 Cal.3d 710; Oakes v. McCarthy Co., supra, 267 Cal.App.2d 231; Aced
v. Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co. (1961) 55 Cal.2d 573 [12 Cal.Rptr. 257,
360 P.2d 897].) In the case of  such latent defects the statute of
limitations begins to run only when "noticeable damage occurs." (
Oakes, supra, at p. 254.)

Oakes, a case specifically dealing with consequential damages
resulting from underground trespass, held that a cause of action
accrues when the surface damage is "sufficiently appreciable to
a reasonable man."  (Oakes, supra, at p.  255.) This standard was
adopted by Regents of University of California v.  Hartford Acc. &
Indem. Co., supra; Mehl v. People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks., supra ;
and Amador Valley Investors v. City of Livermore (1974) 43 Cal.App.3d
483 [117 Cal.Rptr. 749], all involving negligent injury to realty,
and by Aced v.  Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co., supra, involving a breach
of warranty for leaky tubing installed in a concrete slab floor.
It is the standard urged by defendant City of San Mateo in this action.

Plaintiffs urge that this court apply the "rule of discovery" in lieu
of the standard articulated in Oakes.  Although it has been said that
a cause of action under the discovery rule accrues when the plaintiff
discovers or should have discovered all facts essential to his cause
of action  (Saliter v. Pierce Brothers Mortuaries, supra, at p. 296;
Cain v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.  (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 310, 314
[132 Cal.Rptr. 860]; Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand,
supra, at p. 190), this has been interpreted under the discovery rule
to be when "plaintiff either (1) actually discovered his injury and its
negligent cause or (2) could have discovered injury and cause through
the exercise of reasonable diligence [italics added]."  (Sanchez
v. South Hoover Hospital (1976) 18 Cal.3d 93, 96-97 [132 Cal.Rptr. 657,
553 P.2d 1129].  See also Enfield v. Hunt (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 417, 419
[154 Cal.Rptr. 146]; Cain v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra,
at p. 314; G. D. Searle & Co. v. Superior Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d
22, 25 [122 Cal.Rptr. 218]; Allred v. Bekins Wide World Van Services
(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 984, 991 [120 Cal.Rptr. 312].)

The "rule of discovery" has been extended in the tort area to
include all of the following: Sanchez v. South Hoover Hospital, supra
(action  for injury or death against a health care provider under
Code Civ.  Proc., ? 340.5); Neel v.  Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart &
Gelfand, supra (attorney malpractice); Manguso v. Oceanside Unified
School Dist. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 725 [152 Cal.Rptr. 27] (action for
damages for libel); Seelenfreund v. Terminix of Northern Cal., Inc.
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 133 [148 Cal.Rptr. 307] (negligent breach of oral
contract to make a termite inspection and report); Saliter v. Pierce
Brothers Mortuaries, supra (personal injury based on negligent breach
of contract); Cain v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., supra (violation
of right to privacy); G. D. Searle & Co. v. Superior Court, supra
(personal injury based on products liability); Allred v. Bekins Wide
World Van Services, supra (personal injury and damage to personal
property resulting from negligent breach of contract to ship personal
property); Warrington v. Charles Pfizer & Co. (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d
564 [80 Cal.Rptr. 130] (personal injury from negligently manufactured
or marketed drugs); Moonie v. Lynch (1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 361 [64
Cal.Rptr. 55] (accountant's malpractice).

The discovery rule operates to protect the plaintiff who is
"blamelessly ignorant" of his cause of action.  (Frederick v. Calbio
Pharmaceuticals (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 49, 53-54 [152 Cal.Rptr. 292];
G. D. Searle & Co. v. Superior Court, supra, at p. 25.) Accordingly,
we do not think that plaintiffs' cause of action in this case should
accrue from the occurrence of the last essential fact, nor from
discovery of the damage to their property, as defendant contends,
but rather from the point in time when plaintiffs became aware of
defendant's negligence as a cause, or could have become so aware
through the exercise of reasonable diligence.

The ultimate question therefore is whether plaintiffs exercised
reasonable diligence in discovering the negligent cause of their
injuries.   (Enfield v.  Hunt, supra, 91 Cal.App.3d, at p. 423.) We
see no reason to commence the running of the statute of limitations
when plaintiffs, at the outset, made reasonable, but unsuccessful,
efforts to identify the negligent cause of damage.  Where, as in
this case, plaintiffs consulted with professional engineers as to the
source of their injury, they were entitled to rely upon that advice.
(See, Enfield v.  Hunt, supra; Jones v. Queen of the Valley Hospital
(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 700, 703 [153 Cal.Rptr. 662].) It would be
contrary to public policy to require that plaintiffs file a lawsuit
against City of San Mateo at a time when the evidence available to
them failed to indicate a cause of action against  this defendant.
( Enfield v. Hunt, supra, at p. 424; Jones v. Queen of the Valley
Hospital, supra, at p. 703.)

Thus, under the facts alleged by plaintiffs, their cause of action
against the City of San Mateo would have accrued at the time of the
cave-in of the sewer trench.

Whether plaintiffs in fact exercised reasonable diligence in
discovering the negligence of defendant City of San Mateo is a question
of fact  (Enfield v.  Hunt, supra, at p. 419), but we cannot find,
as the trial court did, that as a matter of law plaintiffs' previous
lawsuit put them on notice of their cause of action against the City
of San Mateo.

It is defendant's contention that plaintiffs' Suit I against the
developers and sellers precluded plaintiffs' Suit II against the City
of San Mateo.  It claims that the second suit is identical to the
first, except insofar as the City of San Mateo is named as a defendant,
and that "fundamental rules of pleading" bar the second suit.

We do not agree that the two suits are identical, but assuming arguendo
that this were so, there is no rule of law requiring plaintiffs to have
joined all defendants in one lawsuit.  Joint, concurrent or successive
tortfeasors may be sued separately or jointly at plaintiff's option.
( Helling v. Lew (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 434, 438 [104 Cal.Rptr. 789];
Skelly v. Richman (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 844, 857 [89 Cal.Rptr. 556];
Williams v. Reed (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 195, 204 [248 P.2d 147]; Fowden
v. Pacific Coast Steamship Co. (1906) 149 Cal. 151, 157 [86 P.  178];
3 Witkin,  Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, ? 141, p. 1815;
? 169, p. 1844.)

In the instant case, plaintiffs clearly could have filed two separate
lawsuits at the time they filed the first suit in 1974.  They would
not have been compelled by rules of pleading to join the defendant,
City of San Mateo, in the prior action.

However, the suit against the sellers and developers, and the suit
against defendant City of San Mateo, are not identical as defendant
claims.  Plaintiffs, in Suit I, sued the developers for damage to their
property on theories of defective engineering and manufacture and the
sellers on theories of fraud and nondisclosure.  Recovery against the
City is being sought for inverse condemnation, continuing nuisance,
and  a dangerous and defective condition of public property.  Suit I
was premised on the liability of the developers and sellers for the
condition of plaintiffs' property in July 1972.  In contrast, Suit
II is premised on the liability of the City for a present condition
of its property which not only contributed to the property damage
of which plaintiffs were previously aware, but which plaintiffs
allege has independently caused them damage in the form of tripled
or quadrupled cost of repair. 3

Finally, defendant contends that the releases executed by the
plaintiffs in Suit I worked as a prospective release as to "all
others," including defendant in Suit II, City of San Mateo.  The two
releases executed by the plaintiffs in compromising Suit I are both
printed forms with fill-in blanks.  Both purport to release the named
defendants in Suit I "and all others" from all claims arising out of
the subsidence damage occurring in July 1972.  Both releases contain
printed boiler plate language waiving all rights of plaintiffs under
Civil Code, section 1542, whereby a general release does not extend
to claims not known or suspected to exist.

In support of their contention, defendant cites 12 California
Jurisprudence Third 403, Compromise, Settlement, and Release, section
93, which reads:  "A release naming certain persons to be released
and including all other persons connected with the transaction
is operative as to all persons connected therewith.  Furthermore,
a release may be effective as against successors in interest and
others who were not immediate parties to it.  [Italics added.]"

We have no quarrel with the quoted passage, but point out that such
a release is only operative as to "all other persons connected with
the transaction."  Such a release cannot be interpreted to operate
as to a separate and distinct cause of action against a successive,
independent wrongdoer.  (Lamoreux v. San Diego etc. Ry. Co. (1957) 48
Cal.2d 617, 624 [311 P.2d 1] (employer and negligent third party);
Ash v. Mortensen (1944) 24 Cal.2d 654, 658-659 [150 P.2d 876]
(aggravation of injuries by medical malpractice).)

Furthermore, mere recital, as in the release signed by plaintiffs,
that the protection of Civil Code section 1542 is waived, or that the
release covers unknown claims or unknown parties is not controlling.
Whether the releaser intended to discharge such claims or parties
is ultimately a question of fact.  (Grebe v. McDaniel (1968) 265
Cal.App.2d 901, 903 [71 Cal.Rptr. 662]; Casey v.  Proctor (1963)
59 Cal.2d 97, 110 [28 Cal.Rptr. 307, 378 P.2d 579].)

We therefore reverse the summary judgment entered in this action,
plaintiffs to recover their costs on appeal from defendant City of San
Mateo.  Insofar as the demurrer of cross-defendant San Mateo Investment
Company was granted on the grounds that no cause of action was stated,
it cannot be definitely ascertained from the record that the demurrer
was not sustained because the cross-complaint had been mooted by the
grant of summary judgment.  Therefore, the judgment of dismissal in
favor of cross-defendant San Mateo Investment Company is reversed,
cross-complainant City of San Mateo to bear its own costs on appeal.

[1]: Code of Civil Procedure, section 337.15 reads as follows:
"(a) No action may be brought to recover damages from any person
who develops real property or performs or furnishes the design,
specifications, surveying, planning, supervision, testing, or
observation of construction or construction of an improvement to real
property more than 10 years after the substantial completion of such
development or improvement for any of the following:

"(1) Any latent deficiency in the design, specification, surveying,
planning, supervision, or observation of construction or construction
of an improvement to, or survey of, real property.

"(2) Injury to property, real or personal, arising out of any such
latent deficiency.

"(b) As used in this section, 'latent deficiency' means a deficiency
which is not apparent by reasonable inspection.

"(c) As used in this section, 'action' includes an action for indemnity
brought against a person arising out of his performance or furnishing
of services or materials referred to in this section, except that a
cross-complaint for indemnity may be filed pursuant to Section 442
in an action which has been brought within the time period set forth
in subdivision (a) of this section.

"(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as extending the
period prescribed by the laws of this state for bringing any action.

"(e) The limitation prescribed by this section shall not be asserted
by way of defense by any person in actual possession or the control,
as owner, tenant or otherwise, of such an improvement, at the time
any deficiency in such improvement constitutes the proximate cause
for which it is proposed to bring an action.

"(f) This section shall not apply to actions based on willful
misconduct or fraudulent concealment."

[2]: The applicable statute of limitations for injury to real property
is three years.   (Code Civ. Proc., ? 338, subd. 2.)

In the case of the continuing nuisance, "every repetition of the wrong
may create further liability."  (Nestle v. City of Santa Monica (1972)
6 Cal.3d 920, 937 [101 Cal.Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480].) Where the cause
of action is one for destruction of lateral support, a new and separate
cause of action arises with each new subsidence and any applicable
limitations statute runs separately for each separate subsidence.
(Bellman v. County of Contra Costa (1960) 54 Cal.2d 363, 369 [5
Cal.Rptr. 692, 353 P.2d 300].)

The cases are divided on the application of a three-year or five-year
statute of limitations for actions in inverse condemnation.  (Mehl
v. People ex rel.  Dept. Pub. Wks. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 710, 717, fn. 3
[119 Cal.Rptr. 625, 532 P.2d 489].) The three-year statute is Code
of Civil Procedure, section 338, subd. 2 for trespass and injury to
real property.  Frustuck v. City of Fairfax (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 345,
373-375 [28 Cal.Rptr. 357] espouses a five-year statute of limitations
on the rationale that, "[The] owner's right of recovery is founded
upon and grows out of his title to land and that until such title is
lost by adverse possession the owner should have the right to maintain
an action to recover that which represents the property itself." (
Frustuck, supra, at p.  374; see also Garden Water Corp. v. Fambrough
(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 324 [53 Cal.Rptr. 862].) One case, Ocean
Shore R.R. Co. v. City of Santa Cruz (1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 267 [17
Cal.Rptr. 892], held that both the three-year and five-year statutes
of limitations were applicable to an action in inverse condemnation.

[3]: Plaintiffs allege that the defective condition of defendant's
property has severely aggravated their repair costs, in that the
uncompacted sewer trenches necessitated redesign and partial
reconstruction of the original drainage system.  Furthermore,
plaintiffs claim that as a result, the redesigned system could not
be placed at a sufficient depth to completely stop the subsidence,
and additional costly measures have been taken in an attempt to
mitigate the damage from this ongoing subsidence.
